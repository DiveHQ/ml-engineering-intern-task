Documentation: Generating Meeting Transcript Data for Model Development
Introduction
This documentation outlines the process followed to generate additional meeting transcript data for the purpose of model development. The goal is to expand the existing dataset and provide a more comprehensive training sample.

Steps for Generating Meeting Transcript Data
1. Identifying the Need: Recognize the requirement to expand the dataset and generate more meeting transcript data.

2. Data Format: Use the CSV format with columns: start_time, end_time, speaker, and text.

3. Dialogue Generation: Create artificial dialogue lines for the meeting transcript using short forms.

Example:

"00:00:00","00:00:15","Alice","Good afternoon, everyone!"
"00:00:15","00:00:40","Bob","Good afternoon, Alice. How was your weekend?"
"00:00:40","00:01:00","Alice","It was great, Bob. How about yours?"
4. Time Stamps: Assign hypothetical time stamps in "HH:MM:SS" format to each dialogue line.

Example:

"00:00:00","00:00:15","Alice","Good afternoon, everyone!"
5. Speaker Attribution: Use short forms for speaker names, such as Alice (A), Bob (B), and Carol (C), to differentiate between speakers.

Example:

"00:00:15","00:00:40","B","Good afternoon, Alice. How was your weekend?"
6. Text Crafting: Generate text for each speaker to simulate a meeting discussion using short forms.

Example:

"00:00:15","00:00:40","B","Good afternoon, Alice. How was your weekend?"
7. Relevance and Coherence: Ensure coherence and relevance in the generated dialogue lines using short forms.

Example:

"00:00:40","00:01:00","A","It was great, B. How about yours?"
Limitations and Considerations
1. Artificial Nature of the Data: Generated meeting transcript data is synthetic and doesn't represent real meetings.

2. Limited Variability: The provided data sample is relatively small and may not cover the full range of real meeting conversations.

3. Contextual Considerations: The data lacks specific meeting topics, agendas, or participant roles.

4. Training Data Quality: Manual verification/validation of the generated text was not performed.

##what did you stop considering and why ..?

1. Computationally expensive: Using an NLP library or a machine learning model to extract action items from a meeting transcript would be too computationally expensive for a large meeting transcript.

2. Requires large amount of training data: Using a machine learning model to extract action items from a meeting transcript would require a large amount of training data, which I did not have access to.

Instead, I decided to use a simple regular expression to extract action items from a meeting transcript. This approach is not as sophisticated as using an NLP library or a machine learning model, but it is much simpler and more efficient.

##what did you pick first and why 
because I am familiar with the process..!

## LIMITATIONS

here current approach in the above code has a few limitations:

1. Language Dependency: The code is trained on the BERT model, which is primarily trained on English language data. It may not perform optimally on transcripts or texts in other languages.

2. Contextual Understanding: The code treats each sentence or phrase independently for classification. It does not take into account the context of the entire conversation or the relationships between different statements. This may lead to misclassifications or missing action items that require understanding the conversation as a whole.

3. Action Item Detection: The code relies on a text classification model to identify action items. While it can provide reasonable predictions, it may not be perfect in distinguishing between action items and regular conversation. There is a possibility of false positives or false negatives in the extracted action items.

4. Fine-tuning and Customization: The code uses a pre-trained BERT model that is not fine-tuned specifically for action item extraction from meeting transcripts. Fine-tuning the model on a specific domain or dataset may yield better results. Additionally, the code may require customization to handle specific nuances or variations in meeting transcripts.

5. Performance and Scalability: The code processes the meeting transcripts sequentially and may not be optimized for large-scale or real-time processing of extensive transcripts. For scenarios involving a substantial amount of data or frequent updates, the code may need to be optimized for better performance and scalability.

6. False Positives and Assignee Identification: The code assumes that action items are correctly identified based on the text classification model. However, there is a possibility of false positives, where non-action items are classified as action items. Additionally, the code assigns action items to assignees based on simple heuristics or patterns in the text. It may not accurately determine the intended assignee, especially in complex or ambiguous situations.

-In order to train and test machine learning models that can be used to analyze meeting transcripts, it is necessary to gather a large dataset of meeting transcripts. This data can be gathered from a variety of sources, including:

-Publicly available meeting transcripts: There are a number of websites that make publicly available meeting transcripts available for download. These transcripts can be used to train and test machine learning models without the need to obtain consent from the participants in the meetings.

-Internal meeting transcripts: Many organizations record and transcribe their meetings. These transcripts can be used to train and test machine learning models, but it is important to obtain consent from the participants in the meetings before using their data.

-Transcripts created by researchers: Researchers have created a number of datasets of meeting transcripts that can be used to train and test machine learning models. These datasets are often more difficult to obtain than publicly available transcripts, but they can provide a more diverse and representative dataset of meeting transcripts.
Once a dataset of meeting transcripts has been gathered, it is important to clean and prepare the data for machine learning. This process may involve:

Removing identifying information: It is important to remove any identifying information from the transcripts, such as the names of the participants, the organizations they work for, and the dates and times of the meetings.
Standardizing the format of the transcripts: The format of the transcripts may vary from meeting to meeting. It is important to standardize the format of the transcripts so that they can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms.
Labeling the transcripts: If the goal is to train a model to identify the speaker, the topic of discussion, or the sentiment of the conversation, it is necessary to label the transcripts with this information. This can be done manually or automatically using natural language processing techniques.
