## Description
The project aims to extract action items from meeting transcripts using a pre-trained BERT model for text classification. It identifies sentences or phrases that represent tasks to be done and assigns them to the appropriate assignee. The output is a list of action items with their corresponding assignees.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.11.1 or higher)
- Libraries:
  - torch 
  - transformers

## Installation
1. Install Python:
   - Download and install Python from the official Python website (python.org).

2. Install the required libraries:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     pip install torch
     pip install transformers
     ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Prepare the Meeting Transcripts:
   - Open the project folder.
   - Locate the `transcripts.txt` file.
   - Update the file with the meeting transcripts in the following format:
     ```
     "start_time","end_time","speaker","text"
     "00:00:00","00:00:15","Alice","Good afternoon, everyone!"
     "00:00:15","00:00:40","Bob","Good afternoon, Alice. How was your weekend?"
     ...
     ```
   - Save the file with the updated meeting transcripts.

3. Run the Code:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```
     python ml_model_1.py
     ```

4. Review the Results:
   - The extracted action items will be displayed in the console or output window.
   - Each action item will be shown in the format: `{"text": ..., "assignee": ...}`.
   - Optionally, the timestamp of when the action item was detected can be included.

## Customization and Further Steps
- Customize the code to meet specific requirements, such as modifying the text classification model or integrating with other tools.
- Explore enhancements, such as fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy or integrating with project management tools.
- Refer to the code comments for guidance on customizing or extending the functionality.


## Troubleshooting
- If encountering any errors, ensure that all prerequisites are properly installed.
- Verify that the meeting transcripts are correctly formatted in the `gathered-data.csv` file.
